/**
 * These four values are the whole difference between this build and its sibling.
 *
 * AutoLL-3 and AutoLL-6 are kept as mutual fallbacks and are synced by merging
 * one into the other, so the identity file is the one place a merge is supposed
 * to stop. Nothing in git makes it stop there -- a merge that silently takes the
 * wrong side of this file produces a build that calls itself by the other's
 * name, writes to the other's storage keys, and hands a live Disney session to
 * the other's responder page.
 *
 * So the test does not assert the literal 'AutoLL-3', which would only restate
 * the source file and would have to differ between the two repos. It asserts
 * that the identity agrees with `package.json`, which a merge would have to get
 * wrong in the same direction at the same time for this to pass. That check is
 * identical in both builds, which is the point: it is one fewer file to diverge.
