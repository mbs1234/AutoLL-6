 * they all run injected into `disneyworld.disney.go.com` -- so two of them
 * open at once are two tabs on the same origin, showing the same page title
 * and the same blank favicon. Nothing distinguished them before you opened
 * one and looked at what was on screen.
 *
 * The tab strip is where that question is actually asked, so this is where it
 * is answered. It is the human half of the shared storage namespace: that one
 * stops two builds overwriting each other's data, this one stops you
 * mistaking which is which.

 * the cross-tab quarantine event. Those namespaces are how two builds share
 * `disneyworld.disney.go.com` without overwriting each other, so this value
 * must differ between builds even though nothing ever shows it to anyone.
 *
 * Kept beside `APP_NAME` rather than derived from it: the derivation is a
 * one-liner, but a silent change in how it strips punctuation would silently
 * repoint every stored key. `appIdentity.test.ts` asserts the two agree.
